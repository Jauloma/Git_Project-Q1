# First Project on Sales
This Project is based on storeâ€™s products and sales.
The local government is thinking about imposing a sales tax, and is thinking about 15, 20, and 25 percent rates. Show how much less you would net with each of these tax amounts by adding columns to the data frame for current income, as well.
